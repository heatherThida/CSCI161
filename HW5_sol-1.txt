Let C(n) = the number of different binary trees with n nodes.

C(0) = 1  (the empty tree)
C(1) = 1  (just root node)
C(2) = 2  (as given)

To compute C(3), note that one node must be the root, leaving 2 nodes for the
left and right subtrees.  There are 3 ways to distribute these 2 nodes: (2,
0), (1, 1), or (0, 2).

Hence C(3) = C(2)*C(0) + C(1)*C(1) + C(0)*C(2) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Similarly,

C(4) = C(3)*C(0) + C(2)*C(1) + C(1)*C(2) + C(0)*C(3) = 5+2+2+5 = 14.
